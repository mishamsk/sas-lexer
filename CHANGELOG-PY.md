## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2025-01-05

### Removed
- üõ†Ô∏è stop building py package for win32, as msgspec doesn't support it

### Fixed
- üí• Reworked macro var expression lexing, to properly account for trailing terminating dots. This is a breaking change, as the token types emitted by the lexer have changed. Now instead of one token `MacroVarExpr` for the entire expression, a sequence of `MacroVarResolve`, `MacroString` and optional `MacroVarTerm` are emitted.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2024-11-08

### Added
- Python initial pre-release.
