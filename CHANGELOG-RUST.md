## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2025-01-05

### Added
- ✨ Added two public iterator API's on `TokenizedBuffer`:
  - `iter_tokens` - returns an iterator over token indexes
  - `iter_tokens_infos` - returns an iterator over token infos
    - It uses the new public type: `TokenInfoIter`
- ✨ New buffer API to get fully resolved token text: `get_token_resolved_text` instead of manually checking for string payload

### Changed
- ✨ Made `TokenInfo` public with read-only getters

### Removed
- 🔥 remove IntoIterator impl for TokenizedBuffer

### Fixed
- 💥 Reworked macro var expression lexing, to properly account for trailing terminating dots. This is a breaking change, as the token types emitted by the lexer have changed. Now instead of one token `MacroVarExpr` for the entire expression, a sequence of `MacroVarResolve`, `MacroString` and optional `MacroVarTerm` are emitted.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2024-11-08

### Changed
- Distinguish built-in macro calls and autocall macros that mask comma in arguments from those that don't.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2024-11-07

### Changed
- 📌 Reduce MSRV to 1.74 to allow musl maturin builds

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2024-11-05

### Added
- Rust initial pre-release.
